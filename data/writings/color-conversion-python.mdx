While I’m in my last semester at Telkom University, I attended the Research Group in Multimedia Laboratory. The research we’ve been doing is about Digital Image Processing and Computer Vision. Almost every week, we met and learn about DIP and did some assignments. The second assignment was about image conversion. But before we jump to the idea of image conversion, why we should learn about it?

## Importance of learning color conversion

Well, after doing some research on the internet and digital image processing books, I have some reasons.

First, sometimes processing images on color images (usually on RGB) may take a long time. That’s why, before applying on color images, some algorithms tested or applied on grayscale images or binary images. Or we can say that some algorithms is having big complexity when processed on color images rather than grayscale or binary images.

Second, each color model has its own purposes and advantages. For example, there are several kinds of color models, like `CMYK` that is used for printing, `Lab` which is designed to approximate human vision, color image with transparent `RGBA` used for graphic design, and so on.

There are so many reasons to learn about color conversion, I think there are many sources that discuss more further about it. The fact that different color spaces are better for different applications is interesting to consider.

## Color Conversion

When we talk about conversing an image from a color space to another color space, we absolutely talked about mathematics equations.

In this article, I will discuss 3 color-conversions methods from RGB images. But before we jump to the code, please make sure you have [Python2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2714/) and [OpenCV](https://www.opencv.org/) for Python installed on your machine. I’ll provide codes with two different approaches, using the OpenCV library and without the OpenCV library.

## RGB to Grayscale

We can convert RGB images using this equation

```
y = 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.144B
```

**How it works**:The big difference between RGB image and Grayscale image is their color channel. RGB images have 3 channels, while a Grayscale image only has 1 channel. We take the i-th pixel of channels Red, Green, and Blue then use the equation above to calculate the value at i-th pixel at the Grayscale image. Here’s the implementation in Python.

```python
"""
@file: RGBtoGraysacle.py
@author : Ibe Dwi - @dskusuma
Notes   :
There are two kind of solutions. The first is solution using the Open-CV's
library. The second is without the library.
"""

import numpy as np
import cv2

# Read color image
img = cv2.imread('gambar1.jpg')

# Get the image's height, width, and channels
height, width, channel = img.shape

# Create blank grayscale image
img_grayscale = np.zeros((height,width,1))

# ======================================================
# IMPLEMENTATION USING OPENCV LIBRARY
# ======================================================
#  img_grayscale = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# ======================================================
# IMPLEMENTATION WITHOUT OPENCV LIBRARY
# ======================================================

# CALCULATE
for i in np.arange(height):
    for j in np.arange(width):
        r = img.item(i,j,0)
        g = img.item(i,j,1)
        b = img.item(i,j,2)

        # RGB to Grayscale
        y = 0.299*r + 0.587*g + 0.144*b

        img_grayscale.itemset((i,j,0),int(y))

# Write image
cv2.imwrite('image_grayscale.jpg',img_grayscale)
# View image
cv2.imshow('image',img_grayscale)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

## RGB to Binary

To convert RGB image to Binary image, we have to the RGB image into a Grayscale image first. Then we set the threshold value. Then we use this equation:
